Java script has 3 types of scope:
global scope: Declared outside the function and is accessible within the function. 
local scope also known as script scope: Declared outside the function it cannot be accessed within the function.
block scope : declared within {}.

Variables are divide into 3 types:
var- global scope
let      local scope
const local scope


Re-assigning is possible only by var and let and is not possible for const.
Redeclaration with let and const  is not accepted. It leads to uncalled syntax error.
Redeclaration with var is accepted.
