DOM(Document Object Model):
It is mainly used in web development and is used to interact and manipulate(change) the html documents.
When the webpage loaded, the browser created DOM of the webpage. When the html file is loaded into the browser, the javascript  document cannot directly understand the html document.
DOM: It is basically the representation of the same html document but in a tree-like structure composed of object.
Key points:
1.	Structure: The DOM represents the structure of HTML document, as a tree. Each node in the tree represents the elements, an attribute or text.
2.	Manipulation: using javascript, you can interact wit the elements (buttons, paragraphs) on the webpage, changing the content, styles , can add or remove elements. 
3.	Event Handling: you can handle the interactions, like click or pressing the button.
4.	W3C: world wide web consortium.
